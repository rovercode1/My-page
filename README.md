# D.va
When thinking of who to base my webpage around, I decided to look closer, rather than abstract.
I figured creating a page of a video game character would be good, considering its something I enjoy doing in my spare time.

I recently introduced my girlfriend to Overwatch, and her favourite to play is D.va. Therefore, I thought it would be a good pick for my mini project. 
D.va also has a visually pleasing colour pallete that would be fun to play around with.
